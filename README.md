This project illustrates how to combine SQLite with Python to analyze sales data using SQL queries. A CSV file containing sales data is loaded into a SQLite database, where aggregation queries are run to determine the total sales quantity and revenue for each product line. The data is then retrieved into a Pandas environment for analysis and visualized with Matplotlib to create a bar chart of revenue. This project illustrates real-world expertise in SQL querying, database management, data analysis, and data visualization using Python.
